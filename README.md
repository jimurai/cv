# Curriculum Vitae of Jim Patterson

## Summary

I am an engineer who has spent the last 20+ years working in the development of instrumentation and control systems for consumer products, medical devices and biotech applications.

I've been trained to take an analytical approach to defining a problem before mapping that gained understanding onto models that enable informed decision making throughout the lifecycle of the product development. I can apply this approach equally in the comfort of an internal development environment or in front of customers where I enjoy the challenge of mapping their problems onto our capabilities in real-time.

Equally comfortable operating down at the day-to-day tactical level as well as defining long reach strategies, I can lead lean and effective solution developmentadoption of systems engineering practices and application of tailor-made processes.

These days I most love architecting solutions from day 1 of projects, but I'm still capable of getting hands-on in the lab although even better at passing on these skills to other in order to grow team capabilities, whether it is through mentoring existing team members or focussed recruitment drives.

Fortune has favoured me the opportunities to gain experience in the use of the following fields of instrumentation and control:
* Analogue, mixed-signal and digital circuits.
* PCB and ASIC embodiments of the above.
* Stationary and non-stationary, linear and non-linear dynamical systems.
* Modelling all these solutions at the lowest level using domain specific languages (e.g. SPICE, HDL) or abstracted to the highest level (e.g. Python ODEs).

## Employment History

### Recent Highlights

At [Evonetix][evo], as the Head of Electronics, I joined a team of one and took on the following challenges:
* Grew the team to 10+ over the series A & B funding rounds. More than once bringing in interns and growing them to full-blown engineers.
* Set up our in-house PCB CAD capability including version control, component database, review processes and progress tracking to keep our (internal) customers engaged with the development of their product.
* Introduced test driven development of our VHDL closed-loop control solutions to support our FPGA strategy for highly parallel control systems.
* Helped found our relationship with the [Analog Garage][garage] at Analog Devices.
* Lead the architecture development of our thermal control ASIC with our partners, [Analog Devices][adi] and developed in-house modelling of the ADC to ensure compatibility with our MEMS devices.
* Campaigned for and lead a cross-discipline team to address a significant technical roadblock, adopting Agile methods, and delivered the desired results in a short period of time.

### [Evonetix][evo]

*April 2017 to June 2022*  
**Senior Staff Engineer; Thermal Control Guru**  
Reponsible for Evonetix' thermal control capabilities and integrating them across all groups and workstreams.

*April 2017 to June 2022*  
**Head of Electronics**  
Leading the development of electronic hardware and embedded control systems in order to support the development of Evonetix unique DNA synthesis technology.

### [CMR Surgical][cmr]

*November 2015 to March 2017*  
**Senior Engineer**  
Had a leading role in the development of electronics hardware for the Versius surgical robotic system. Primary contributions were enhanced quality control for PCB CAD procedures as well as PCB testing procedures and EMC compliance activities.

### [Cambridge Mechatronics Ltd.][cml]

*June 2012 to November 2015*  
**Lead Electronics Engineer**  
Developed reference hardware design for shape memory alloy actuators used in Optical Image Stabilisation for mobile phone cameras. MCU, gyroscope and analogue resistance sensing incorporated into 8.1 x 4.5mm circuit design. Required use of high density features such as copper filled microvias, buried via for 0.4mm pitch WL-CSP packages. Designed to be manufactured in millions per month.

Lead the development of advanced control features to ensure OIS product met customer requirements while being robust to manufacturing tolerances of a very high volume actuator. Applied test-drive development methodology to improve communications and product quality when managing a small software development team.

### [Imperial College London][icl]

My [PhD][thesis] from Imperial College London was in biomedical electronics where I researched techniques to enable continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with minimum impact on their lives as part of the [Body Sensor Networks]([bsn]) team at the Hamlyn Centre. The outcome was a pulse oximeter sensor that combined high-dynamic range noise rejection with embedded signal analysis and sub-10mW power consumption using only off-the-shelf components.

I also supported multiple other research campaigns by providing electronic hardware and software development with product development grade quality.

*October 2008 to March 2012*  
**Research Associate**:
Developed sensor systems to assist elite athlete training in the run up to the London 2012 Olympics ([ESPRIT][esprit]).

**PhD Candidate**:
Thesis titled: [*"A Photoplethysmography System Optimised for Wearable Pervasive Cardiac Monitoring"*][thesis]. Involved finding a robust solution to optical noise issues that could be implemented in a minimal number of circuit components.

### [Cambridge Consultants Ltd.][ccl]

*September 2004 to September 2008*  
**Senior Engineer, Engineer**   
*September 1999 to July 2000*  
**Technology Scholar**

Delivered designs for a wide range of consumer and medical products on tight time-lines and budget constraints.  Everything from implantable wireless devices to intelligent ironing boards. Also mentored gap year students ("technology scholars"). Latterly contributed to planning of large projects and managing of smaller projects.

I am a technologist who has spent the last 20+ years working in the development of instrumentation and control systems for consumer products, medical devices and biotech applications. Formally, I'm an electronic engineer, but it is the multi-discplinary opportunities presented by healthcare and synthetic biology challenges that I identify with most.

I've been trained to take an analytical approach to defining a problem before mapping that gained understanding onto models that enable informed decision making throughout the lifecycle of the product development. I can apply this approach equally in the comfort of an internal development environment or in front of customers where I enjoy the challenge of mapping their problems onto our capabilities in real-time. It is this setting where my passion for clear and concise communication, whether it be creating and delivering presentations or producing technical documentation, get to shine.

Equally comfortable operating down at the day-to-day tactical level as well as defining long reach strategies, I can lead lean and effective solution development through adoption of systems engineering practices and application of tailor-made processes.

These days I most love architecting solutions from day 1 of projects, but I'm still capable of getting hands-on in the lab although even better at passing on these skills to other in order to grow team capabilities, whether it is through mentoring existing team members or focussed recruitment drives.

Fortune has favoured me the opportunities to gain experience in the use of the following fields of instrumentation and control:
* Analogue, mixed-signal and digital circuits.
* PCB and ASIC embodiments of the above.
* Stationary and non-stationary, linear and non-linear dynamical systems.
* Modelling all these solutions at the lowest level using domain specific languages (e.g. SPICE, HDL) or abstracted to the highest level (e.g. Python ODEs).

## Recent History

At [Evonetix][evo], as the Head of Electronics, I joined a team of one and took on the following challenges:
* Grew the team to 10+ over the series A & B funding rounds. More than once bringing in interns and growing them to full-blown engineers.
* Set up our in-house PCB CAD capability including version control, component database, review processes and progress tracking to keep our (internal) customers engaged with the development of their product.
* Introduced test driven development of our VHDL closed-loop control solutions to support our FPGA strategy for highly parallel control systems.
* Helped found our relationship with the [Analog Garage][garage] at Analog Devices.
* Led the architecture development of our thermal control ASIC with our partners, [Analog Devices][adi] and developed in-house modelling of the ADC to ensure compatibility with our MEMS devices.
* Campaigned for and lead a cross-discipline team to address a significant technical roadblock, adopting Agile methods, and delivered the desired results in a short period of time.

In late 2021, I identified the need for someone at Evonetix to take ownership for our thermal control capability and I put my hand up for that responsibility. The first step was to find someone who could take over the Electronics team. Once the team were in safe hands, I could focus on defining the capability, resolving any outstanding issues residing in our workstreams, and delivering the thermal strategy for our product with a quality plan and technology roadmap to see us all the way through to delivery customers.

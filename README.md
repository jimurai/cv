## Education

**PhD, Pervasive Sensing, Department of Computing**  
*Imperial College London, 2008-2012*  
Thesis titled: [*"A Photoplethysmography System Optimised for Wearable Pervasive Cardiac Monitoring"*][thesis]. Involved finding a robust solution to optical noise issues that could be implemented in a minimal number of circuit components. The outcome was a pulse oximeter sensor that combined high-dynamic range noise rejection with embedded signal analysis and sub-10mW power consumption using only off-the-shelf components.

* Low-power, low noise integrating transimpedance amplifier

* Embedded signal processing on Cortex-M3
* Current-conveyor based analogue front end for mixed-signal ASIC (TSMC 180nm)
 
**MEng, 1st class, Electrical and Electronic Engineering**  
*Imperial College London, 2000-2004*  
Course selection focussed on control engineering and analogue circuit design. Final year project researched temperature compensation for MEMS seismometer for use on Mars.

### Hobbies

Growing up in Texas made me obsessed with slow & low barbecue which I exercise on my Green Mountain Grills Trek pellet smoker. I'm a 3rd generation biker and keep looking for excuses to get back into trackdays but keep myself entertained either commuting or touring with mates on my BMW R1200 RS.

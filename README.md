## Education

**PhD, Pervasive Sensing, Department of Computing**  
*Imperial College London, 2008-2012*  
My [PhD][thesis] from Imperial College London was in biomedical electronics where I researched techniques to enable continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with minimum impact on their lives as part of the [Body Sensor Networks][bsn] team at the Hamlyn Centre. The outcome was a pulse oximeter sensor that combined high-dynamic range noise rejection with embedded signal analysis and sub-10mW power consumption using only off-the-shelf components.

I also supported multiple other research campaigns by providing electronic hardware and software development with product development grade quality.
 
**MEng, 1st class, Electrical and Electronic Engineering**  
*Imperial College London, 2000-2004*  
Course selection focussed on control engineering and analogue circuit design. Final year project researched temperature compensation for MEMS seismometer for use on Mars.

### Hobbies

Growing up in Texas has made me obsessed with slow & low barbecue which I exercise on my Green Mountain Grills Trek pellet smoker. I'm a 3rd generation motorbiker and keep looking for excuses to get back into trackdays but keep myself entertained either commuting or touring with mates on my BMW R1200 RS.

# Curriculum Vitae of Jim Patterson

I am a technologist who has spent the last 20+ years working in the development of instrumentation and control systems for consumer products, medical devices and biotech applications. Formally, I'm an electronic engineer, but it is the multi-discplinary opportunities presented by healthcare and synthetic biology challenges that I identify with most.

## Employment History

### [Evonetix][evo]

*April 2017 to June 2022*  
**Senior Staff Engineer; Thermal Control Guru**  
Reponsible for Evonetix' thermal control capabilities and integrating them across all groups and workstreams.

*April 2017 to June 2022*  
**Head of Electronics**  
Leading the development of electronic hardware and embedded control systems in order to support the development of Evonetix unique DNA synthesis technology.

### [CMR Surgical][cmr]

*November 2015 to March 2017*  
**Senior Engineer**  
Had a leading role in the development of electronics hardware for the Versius surgical robotic system. Primary contributions were enhanced quality control for PCB CAD procedures as well as PCB testing procedures and EMC compliance activities.

### [Cambridge Mechatronics Ltd.][cml]

*June 2012 to November 2015*  
**Lead Electronics Engineer**  
Developed reference hardware design for shape memory alloy actuators used in Optical Image Stabilisation for mobile phone cameras. MCU, gyroscope and analogue resistance sensing incorporated into 8.1 x 4.5mm circuit design. Required use of high density features such as copper filled microvias, buried via for 0.4mm pitch WL-CSP packages. Designed to be manufactured in millions per month.

Lead the development of advanced control features to ensure OIS product met customer requirements while being robust to manufacturing tolerances of a very high volume actuator. Applied test-drive development methodology to improve communications and product quality when managing a small software development team.

### [Imperial College London][icl]

My [PhD][thesis] from Imperial College London was in biomedical electronics where I researched techniques to enable continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with minimum impact on their lives as part of the [Body Sensor Networks]([bsn]) team at the Hamlyn Centre. The outcome was a pulse oximeter sensor that combined high-dynamic range noise rejection with embedded signal analysis and sub-10mW power consumption using only off-the-shelf components.

I also supported multiple other research campaigns by providing electronic hardware and software development with product development grade quality.

*October 2008 to March 2012*  
**Research Associate**:
Developed sensor systems to assist elite athlete training in the run up to the London 2012 Olympics ([ESPRIT][esprit]).

**PhD Candidate**:
Thesis titled: [*"A Photoplethysmography System Optimised for Wearable Pervasive Cardiac Monitoring"*][thesis]. Involved finding a robust solution to optical noise issues that could be implemented in a minimal number of circuit components.

### [Cambridge Consultants Ltd.][ccl]

*September 2004 to September 2008*  
**Senior Engineer, Engineer**   
*September 1999 to July 2000*  
**Technology Scholar**

Delivered designs for a wide range of consumer and medical products on tight time-lines and budget constraints.  Everything from implantable wireless devices to intelligent ironing boards. Also mentored gap year students ("technology scholars"). Latterly contributed to planning of large projects and managing of smaller projects.

### Hobbies

Growing up in Texas has made me obsessed with Slow&Low barbecue which I exercise on my Green Mountains Grill Trek pellet smoker. I'm a 3rd generation motorbiker and keep looking for excuses to get back into trackdays but keep myself entertained either commuting or touring with mates on my BMW R1200 RS.
